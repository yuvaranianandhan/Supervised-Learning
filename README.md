Task - To predict scores of a student baased on their study hours


Task Overview:
The task involves building a predictive model that can estimate the score of a student based on the number of hours they have studied. You will be provided with a dataset containing the number of study hours and the corresponding scores achieved by a group of students. Your goal is to train a supervised machine learning algorithm on this dataset to predict the score of a student given the number of study hours.

Dataset:
The dataset for this task will be provided to you in a structured format, such as a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file. It consists of two columns: "Hours" and "Score." The "Hours" column represents the number of study hours, and the "Score" column contains the corresponding scores achieved by the students.
